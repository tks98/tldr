# tl;dr

This repository showcases three different frameworks (Django, Flask, and Golang Gin) to demonstrate the creation of a web application that generates PDF summaries using OpenAI's APIs.

The primary goal of this repository is to understand the differences between these frameworks and learn how each can be leveraged for building such applications.

## Features

- Upload PDFs from your browser
- Generate a summary of the PDF
- View the summary directly in the app
